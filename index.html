        years are underweight, and 38 per cent have stunted growth. <br />
        <br />
        The grave food crisis that is afflicting the peoples of the developing
        countries where most of the world's hungry and ill-nourished live and
        where more than two thirds of the world's population produce about one
        third of the world's food-an imbalance which threatens to increase in the
        next 10 years-is not only fraught with grave economic and social
        implications, but also acutely jeopardizes the most fundamental principles
        and values associated with the right to life and human dignity as
        enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights <br />
        <br />
        The elimination of hunger and malnutrition, included as one of the
        objectives in the United Nations Declaration on Social Progress and
        Development, and the elimination of the causes that determine this
        situation are the common objectives of all nations <br />
        <br />
        <img src="photos/2nd.jfif" alt="" style="
          width: 500px;
          border-radius: 30px;

          margin-right: 10px;
        " />
        The situation of the peoples afflicted by hunger and malnutrition arises
        from their historical circumstances, especially social inequalities,
        including in many cases alien and colonial domination, foreign occupation,
        racial discrimination, apartheid and neo-colonialism in all its forms,
        which continue to be among the greatest obstacles to the full emancipation
        and progress of the developing countries and all the peoples involved<br />
        <br />

        This situation has been aggravated in recent years by a series of crises
        to which the world economy has been subjected, such as the deterioration
        in the international monetary system, the inflationary increase in import
        costs, the heavy burdens imposed by external debt on the balance of
        payments of many developing countries, a rising food demand partly due to
        demographic pressure, speculation, and a shortage of, and increased costs
        for, essential agricultural inputs<br />
        <br />

        These phenomena should be considered within the framework of the on-going
        negotiations on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, and
        the General Assembly of the United Nations should be urged unanimously to
        agree upon, and to adopt, a Charter that will be an effective instrument
        for the establishment of new international economic relations based on
        principles of equity and justice<br />
        <br />

        All countries, big or small, rich or poor, are equal. All countries have
        the full right to participate in the decisions on the food problem; <br />
        <br />
        Peace and justice encompass an economic dimension helping the solution of
        the world economic problems, the liquidation of under-development,
        offering a lasting and definitive solution of the food problem for all
        peoples and guaranteeing to all countries the right to implement freely
        and effectively their development programmes.<br /><br />
        To this effect, it is necessary to eliminate threats and resort to force
        and to promote peaceful co-operation between States to the fullest extent
        possible, to apply the principles of non-interference in the internal
        affairs of other States, full equality of rights and respect of national
        independence and sovereignty, as well as to encourage the peaceful
        co-operation between all States, irrespective of their political, social
        and economic systems.<br /><br />
        The further improvement of international relations will create better
        conditions for international o-operation in all fields which should make
        possible large financial and material resources to be used, inter alia ,
        for developing agricultural production and substantially improving world
        food security<br />

        We're not giving up the fight against hunger! Let us work together to make
        tomorrow a better place.<br /><br />

        The earth generates sufficient food to feed everyone alive today. We have
        enough food to feed 10 billion people, according to the UN's Food and
        Agriculture Organization. However, because of some people's wasteful
        habits, this food does not reach everyone. This waste starts with the
        farmer and ends with us, the customers.<br /><br />

        The provision of enough nourishment for all people is the first and most
        important component of social justice. All people born into this earth
        have a moral entitlement to food.<br /><br />

        Despite the fact that we are a country that prides itself on its strength
        and money, millions of children go hungry every day. It is not only our
        duty, but it is also our responsibility.<br /><br />
        Many people want to contribute to this cause but they didn’t have the idea
        how to do that, that’s where our role comes in, This platform is designed
        to eradicate hunger in the world by linking food doners and the
        organisations who have taken steps to eradicate hunger by providing food
        to the needy ones, examples NGO’s, local groups, religious places etc.

        India celebrates about 10 million weddings per year. So there we get the
        idea how much food is wasted in India. But not just in India we can
        imagine how much food is wasted in world level. But we can utilise this
        food by saving this food and providing this food to needy ones at write
        time.<br /><br />

        What if we contact the NGO’s or the authorities which provide food to
        needy ones, at the times of function in which there is very much
        probability to wasting food. So by that we are saving the food and
        providing it to people and solving the problem of hunger.
